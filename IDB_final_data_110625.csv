differentiation policy (to increase organic production) could not be used as a way to reduce poverty  because it would probably increase the vulnerability of the rural agents
affected by such policy.

 if no action is taken to generate a link between supply and demand (either foreign or national)for organic products, the substitution effect from an increase in the price of an agricultural commodity will not have the expected results and will generate incentives to decrease the production of the commodity.

Productivity is also simulated under two different soil management scenarios: soil fertility stress vs optimal fertility conditions. The primary outcome variable of interest is the water footprint, which measures the relationship between the amount of water used by the crop - CWU (m3 ha−1) and its land productivity - Y (ton ha− 1).

Effect of cooperatives is positive and statistically significant. Effect of SIE relative to SIF is not statistically significant. However, effect of SIM relative to SIF is positive and statistically significant, suggesting that SIM increases TE and SIF decreases efficiency.

Los resultados de las regresiones sugieren que la expansión del área de cultivos sobre áreas de pastizales y bosques en Brasil no está relacionada con una caída de productividad en estas nuevas áreas a mediano y largo plazo, mientras que para las variaciones anuales se observan efectos prácticamente nulos. De esta forma, los resultados obtenidos en el presente estudio sugieren que no es adecuado considerar para Brasil que la conversión de áreas de pastizales y bosques en áreas de cultivos sea capaz de reducir la productividad de estas áreas en un 50% en relación a las áreas de cultivo ya establecida",
