differentiation policy (to increase organic production) could not be used as a way to reduce poverty  because it would probably increase the vulnerability of the rural agents
affected by such policy.

 if no action is taken to generate a link between supply and demand (either foreign or national)for organic products, the substitution effect from an increase in the price of an agricultural commodity will not have the expected results and will generate incentives to decrease the production of the commodity.

Productivity is also simulated under two different soil management scenarios: soil fertility stress vs optimal fertility conditions. The primary outcome variable of interest is the water footprint, which measures the relationship between the amount of water used by the crop - CWU (m3 ha‚àí1) and its land productivity - Y (ton ha‚àí 1).
